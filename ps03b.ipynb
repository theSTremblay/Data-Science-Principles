    "Luckily, scikit-learn has this dataset available to use. This part will have you setup their dataset to be used for classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, download the boston dataset from **scikit-learn**.\n",
    "    - They should have a module that allows you to download it directly: [load_boston](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html)\n",
    "    - After calling **load_boston()**, it should return a dictionary-like object that contains information.\n",
    "    - The data itself is found in the **.data** item in the dictionary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Notice that .data has shape **(506,13)**. It does not have any given labels, but we will create our own synthetic labels.\n",
    "    - Extract the first column from this matrix (i.e. index 0). \n",
    "    - Calculate the median of this column.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Now we will assign our own **y** based on the following:\n",
    "    - Assign a class of **0** to each sample (row) if the first column is **less than** the above median.\n",
    "    - Assign **1** otherwise (i.e. it has a value **greater than or equal to** the median).\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Finally, we will define our dataset:\n",
    "    - **X**: all data samples using every feature **EXCEPT** for the first column. \n",
